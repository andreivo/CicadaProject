# About

The Cicada Project is a collaboration between Cemaden and Unifesp and was born out of a need by Cemaden. Cemaden has an Observational network with more than 5000 Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) spread across the Brazilian territory. DCPs, in general, are imported equipment and require specialized labor; that is, it consumes a lot of financial resources to maintain its operation.
