# Cicada Broker - Getting Started

The Cicada Project was developed to send data through the MQTT protocol. In this project, the RabbitMQ server was used as the basis for Cicada Broker.

RabbitMQ is an open-source messaging server (open source) developed in Erlang, implemented to support messages in the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) natively; also, it has an adapter for MQTT.  It makes it possible to deal with message traffic quickly and reliably, in addition to being compatible with several programming languages, having a native administration interface, and being multiplatform.

Among the applications of RabbitMQ are to make it possible to guarantee asynchronicity between applications, decrease the coupling between applications, distribute alerts, and control the queue of jobs in the background.
