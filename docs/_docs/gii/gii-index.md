# Group II - Cicada Broker

The project was developed to send data through the MQTT protocol. In this project, the RabbitMQ server was used as the basis for Cicada Broker.
Cicada Broker was also developed using FIND-SE's best practices and proposed a standard protocol for sending and receiving environmental data.
